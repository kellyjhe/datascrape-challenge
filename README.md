# Datascrape Challenge
In this challenge, I scraped data  on the Mars News website using HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. This was done for the Data Analytics and Visualizations Certification at UC Berkeley Extension.

## Process overview
Part 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles
  - Automated browsing (with Splinter) was used to visit the Mars news site, and code was extracted (with Beautiful Soup).
  - Scraped information was stored in Python data structure

Part 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data.
  - Extract HTML table into a Pandas DataFrame
  - Analyze data to discover the amount of months on Mars and answer questions on temperature and pressure characteristics.
  - Export DataFrame into a CSV file

## Tools used
Jupyter Notebook, Python, Pandas
